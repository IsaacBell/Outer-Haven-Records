Outer Haven Records
=========


Outer Haven Records is young, forward-thinking record label and A/V production studio. Founded in 2016, the label is dedicated to serving independent artists with a need for videography, music post-production, or art direction. In addition, Outer Haven is a hub for visual artists to collaborate and publish full art projects, visual experiments, graphical demos, and more. We are excited to present the creative inspiration of tomorrow.
